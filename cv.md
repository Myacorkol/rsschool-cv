### Briefly About Myself

Having started my career as a customer manager in a sales company with minimal skills,  
I grew into a sales team leader within the same company.  
My growing interest in creating web pages led me to a position as a Technical Support Manager  
in an IT company, where I continued self-learning and exploring web technologies.

Three years ago, I became passionate about retouching.  
I mastered various retouching techniques, learned to work with a graphic tablet,  
became an advanced Photoshop user, and found my first job as a retoucher.

Since then, I’ve been working remotely, which gives me more flexibility and time to focus on professional development.  
I’m currently studying Frontend Development and find it inspiring because of its creative nature  
and endless potential for growth.

I believe my curiosity, adaptability, and strong self-learning skills will help me become a proficient Frontend Developer.
